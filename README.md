# EmailWriter
Smart Email Assistant streamlines your inbox with AI-generated replies powered by Googleâ€™s Gemini API. Built with a Java Spring Boot backend, React frontend, and a Chrome extension, it supports multiple tones (professional, casual, humorous, and more), reducing drafting time by ~50%. Prompt-engineering tweaks and fast parsing keep responses accurate and under 2 seconds.
